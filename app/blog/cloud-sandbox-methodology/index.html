                A solutions architect needs to demo infrastructure capabilities for an expansion opportunity on Friday. 
                The demo requires cloud resources. It's Tuesday. By the time IT provisions access, procurement approves spend, 
                and finance approves a cost code, it's the following Wednesday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technical adaptation requires agility and speed. Proof-of-concepts don't have to be perfect; they just need to work. 
                Engineers think fast and in turn need to work fast to stay current. That means when an idea or opportunity arises, 
                work started yesterday. When a client-facing team comes to internal IT expecting to use corporate cloud platforms to 
                support their work, they don't expect roadblocks—they expect a gold stamp and a loose leash. A shorter leash can spin 
                into a gamut of issues: frustration, executive dissatisfaction, and ultimately lost revenue. This leads to retros where 
                executives ask, "Why did this happen?" and the best answer is "It's complicated."
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Problem: Death by Email Chains</h2>
            <p>
                Here's my story with a previous company. Client-facing engineering teams would frequently request space in a cloud platform to develop new 
                infrastructure with the goal of presenting the concept and winning new business. There was no true process at the beginning, and the email 
                chains looked a lot like this:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Hi Colin, can you provision me a sandbox in Azure? We are working on XYZ AI to do ABC for Q."</em><br>
                <em>"Sure, can you submit a ticket with what you need?"</em><br>
                <em>"Yes."</em><br>
                [3 days later]<br>
                <em>"Hi Colin, status on sandbox?"</em><br>
                <em>"I never saw a ticket. Can you please submit one?"</em><br>
                <em>"Yes, sorry. This is urgent, can it be done today?"</em><br>
                <em>"No, I need to know what you're doing, who needs access, how much you're going to spend, and the lifespan. 
                    Did your budget manager approve?"</em><br>
                <em>"Okay why can't this be done today?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                You get the point.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was inevitable in the context of a publicly traded government contracting company. Compliance came first, 
                second, and third. Step 0 was documentation of every cent and every ACL update. Touch points were aplenty: 
                Solution Architect requests sandbox → Help desk ticket → IT approves access → IT approves expenditure with 
                signatures → Budget manager approves cost code → Procurement approves expenditure → Procurement indicates payment method.
            </p>
            <p>
                Automation was non-existent. Emails saying "approved" rained like an April afternoon. All of this had to happen 
                before I could even provision a sandbox, so it could take two weeks before I logged into a cloud platform to grant 
                access. Sometimes estimates would change. Other times approvals weren't given, so back to the drawing board.
            </p>
            <p>
                For initiatives that are meant to increase revenue via quick, cheap demos, this timeline was unacceptable. The only 
                tailwind we had was that clients moved at the speed of government. But client-facing teams have client-facing work 
                to do—they can't spend their time waiting for administrative tasks to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where my work started. The process needed to be improved and understood by everyone involved. So, I put ideas 
                into motion.
            </p>

            <h2>Understanding the Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                Each involved department had a different set of needs. I took the time to sit down with a member from each team to 
                understand exactly what they would need for these scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>IT</strong> needed access control managed via help desk tickets with proper manager approvals. They also 
                required cost tracking through expenditure requests, each requiring dual signatures, and coordination to ensure 
                everything stays on track: invoicing, naming, and timelines must be understood by all involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Procurement</strong> validated expenditure requests with budget manager approval. Their critical need: 
                invoicing must show differentiation between projects, so Sandbox 1 gets charged to Cost Code 1, Sandbox 2 to Cost 
                Code 2, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Budget Managers</strong> approved expenses on cost codes. Their approval was usually swift: approve $X for 
                three months on cost code Q.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Client Teams</strong> must give accurate cost estimates. Budgets were strictly enforced: even an extra penny 
                needed a supplementary procurement request, kicking 60% of this process back into motion. They needed to list precisely 
                what they required: service principals with elevated roles, GitHub Enterprise licenses, specific resource types.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Executive Sponsors</strong>, as C-level leadership, needed to know progress, roadblocks, and causes. They'd 
                start with solution architects and follow the process when problems arose. Keeping them updated and satisfied was critical.
            </p>
            <p>
                Across all these requirements, we had a perfect storm of complexity. The "people factor" comes into play here, too. One 
                of these approvers is out on PTO for the week? Scramble to find an alternate or fall five days behind.
            </p>

            <h2>The Solution: Standardization + Automation</h2>
            
            <h3>Standardized Request Fields</h3>
            <p>
                The easiest win was front-loading the requirements gathering. Put the onus on the architects to know precisely what they
                 need before they ask. If I had all the information upfront, downstream issues became much easier to resolve. The must-have list:
            </p>
            <p>
                Project Name • Cloud Platform • Project Manager • Technical Lead (Architect) • Executive Sponsor • Team Members • Cost Code • Monthly Budget • Project Length
            </p>
            <p>
                This may seem short given the complexity, but I merged some requirements into the technical implementation to simplify. 
                This eliminated my need to follow up on specifics while spinning everything up.
            </p>

            <h3>Templated Cloud Environments</h3>
            <p>
                We implemented this in Azure and AWS. For Azure, the logically separate yet centrally managed answer was subscriptions: individual 
                subscriptions inside a Sandbox management group under the main corporate tenant. Invoicing was done per-subscription, satisfying 
                half of procurement's invoice needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Budgeting became easier. If expenditures were given as a total, I'd apply the budget across the lifespan. $1,200 for three months 
                means $400 per month. Starting mid-month? $200, $400, $400, $200 to span three months. Combined with customized alerts: forecast on 
                the 1st going over budget? Email the Technical Lead and myself. Additional alerts at 90%, 95%, 97%, 99%, and 100% of actual spend 
                for worst-case situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Access control was straightforward. Since sandbox users were cloud engineers and other technical roles, we didn't need 
                fine-grained IAM roles. I created a single IAM role—Technical Lead—with all permissions except budget modification. This was 
                templated and created during subscription provisioning. The Technical Lead from the initial request received that role, then 
                added their team with appropriate access.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the IT side, I created a security group of designated team members with Owner permissions on the Sandbox management group. This 
                security group inherits Owner roles on all child subscriptions, to be used if intervention was needed.
            </p>

            <h3>Granular Cost Tracking</h3>
            <p>
                The other half of procurement's need was determining which cost code corresponded to each project. They received invoices 
                from Azure and AWS with separate charges for each project, but how could they determine which charge went where?
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed a nomenclature for subscriptions: the project name consisted of procurement's assigned ID (for the PDF template) 
                and the project name. For example: "0703-Cloud-AI-Chatbot". The procurement team could easily cross-reference their approved 
                expenditures to validate spend.
            </p>
            <p>
                Side note: I considered other approaches like resource tagging or invoice sections, but since procurement was unfamiliar with 
                cloud billing structures, I opted for the most visible solution: subscription naming. Simplicity over technical purity.
            </p>

            <h2>Results and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Follow-up calls with each team went well. The process was received well by the technical crowds, and the non-technical crowds 
                expected a bit of a learning curve. Once familiarity developed, the process became a well-oiled machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                We talked about sandbox provisioning in terms of days instead of weeks. Email chains quickly shrank from 20-30 to 10, with the 
                10th being my green light for engineers to start work. The next 5 sandboxes were smooth and simple, especially with the architects 
                having a readily available list of all the required information. They gathered that and sent it to me all at once, so I could 
                immediately go through the right channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Friction remained when projects needed more than basic cloud resources. Incorporating identity providers, service principals 
                needing specific permissions, and other one-offs still needed intervention to ensure compliance. For instance, I had to work with 
                a team to increase resource quotas in AWS, since they didn't have permission to initiate those support cases.
            </p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            
            <h3>Process Before Automation</h3>
            <p>
                When dealing with a process whose failure has extreme consequence, it's important to start from step zero. Figure out what's 
                going on, the pain points, then use that context to develop refinements.
            </p>

            <h3>Understand Each Stakeholder's "Why"</h3>
            <p>
                Each team has their own objective, but at the end of the day, these projects are crucial to continued business success. Rather 
                than swinging the hammer of "mission-critical," address each party's concerns through their eyes.
            </p>

            <h3>Templates Are Your Friend</h3>
            <p>
                Having templated roles and permission sets was paramount from an IAM perspective. From an audit perspective, we had demonstrable 
                control over spend and no potential for cross-environment contamination.
            </p>

            <h3>What I'd Do Differently</h3>
            <p>
                I would continue to build on this idea. There was significant effort put towards further automation using SharePoint, Microsoft Forms, 
                and Power Automate. This would automate approvals instead of leaving them in email and open the door for executive visibility into 
                ongoing projects with a centralized list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another substantial improvement would be Infrastructure-as-Code. While I did have ARM templates for roles and such, I didn't get 
                the chance to translate that into a plug-and-play script that could take the fields and spin up everything automagically.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Customer-Facing Roles</h2>
            <p>
                This type of thinking is crucial for customer-facing roles. Understanding why certain guardrails are in place, where pain 
                points are, and developing a solution based on those constraints creates satisfactory outcomes for all parties. Well-designed 
                processes act as a force multiplier. The thought put into design pays dividends when people can fight real problems, not bureaucracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best infrastructure isn't just technically sound—it enables the people who depend on it to do their jobs effectively. 
                hat's what solutions engineering is all about.
